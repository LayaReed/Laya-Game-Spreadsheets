# Laya's Game Spreadsheets
## Introduction

Hello, this is Laya. I've been creating spreadsheets and sharing them to reddit for the last couple of years. A friend of mine recommended me to just consolidate all of them to a Github. Benefits were if I make edits people could hear about it easier if they follow the page, and the second benefit would be it's all in one place. 

I am going to try and finish up some of the spreadsheets I have in backlog, but I am going to put up what is currently done as of right now. 

In some of my spreadsheets I have a google forms thing, I will keep that in case some people prefer to use that over Github things. 

I would appreciate if anyone finds issues to add them to the bug list. I don't always see my discord or reddit, and I'm hoping the Github will also help me in that aspect. 

Another goal I have is to eventually convert the spreadsheets to work in excel and possibly create a pdf file of these for digital or printable journals. I know some people really like the pdf style and I will try and get to that eventually. Current timeline tree is: Github creation and upload -> Edit existing spreadsheets -> Finish spreadsheets backlog -> convert into excel file and pdf formats.

I hope these spreadsheets continue to help in the future. 

Many thanks,
Laya Reed :3
